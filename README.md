Online attendance app:
In this project, you are going to make an App that will help sales agents to give their attendance
to different stores across the city.
What will the agent experience:
When an agent enters the app, he will see a list of stores in the app. The stores should come from
an API describe below. To give attendance to a store, the agent should click on the desired store.
On click, the agent should see a page with two input text fields name and userId with a submit

post request to submit the attendance information with the current location of the user taken from
deviceâ€™s current location.
